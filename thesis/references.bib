	abstract = {Data from in vivo and in vitro experiments are discussed to emphasize that synaptic activities in neocortex and thalamus have a decisive impact on intrinsic neuronal properties in intact-brain preparations under anesthesia and even more so during natural states of vigilance. Thus the firing patterns of cortical neuronal types are not inflexible but may change with the level of membrane potential and during periods rich in synaptic activity. The incidences of some cortical cell classes (defined by their responses to depolarizing current pulses) are different in isolated cortical slabs in vivo or in slices maintained in vitro compared with the intact cortex of naturally awake animals. Network activities, which include the actions of generalized modulatory systems, have a profound influence on the membrane potential, apparent input resistance, and backpropagation of action potentials. The analysis of various oscillatory types leads to the conclusion that in the intact brain, there are no “pure” rhythms, generated in simple circuits, but complex wave sequences (consisting of different, low- and fast-frequency oscillations) that result from synaptic interactions in corticocortical and corticothalamic neuronal loops under the control of activating systems arising in the brain stem core or forebrain structures. As an illustration, it is shown that the neocortex governs the synchronization of network or intrinsically generated oscillations in the thalamus. The rhythmic recurrence of spike bursts and spike trains fired by thalamic and cortical neurons during states of decreased vigilance may lead to plasticity processes in neocortical neurons. If these phenomena, which may contribute to the consolidation of memory traces, are not constrained by inhibitory processes, they induce seizures in which the neocortex initiates the paroxysms and controls their thalamic reflection. The results indicate that intact-brain preparations are necessary to investigate global brain functions such as behavioral states of vigilance and paroxysmal activities.},

	abstract = {Understanding the origin of the main physiological processes involved in consciousness is a major challenge of contemporary neuroscience, with crucial implications for the study of Disorders of Consciousness (DOC). The difficulties in achieving this task include the considerable quantity of experimental data in this field, along with the non-intuitive, nonlinear nature of neuronal dynamics. One possibility of integrating the main results from the experimental literature into a cohesive framework, while accounting for nonlinear brain dynamics, is the use of physiologically-inspired computational models. In this study, we present a physiologically-grounded computational model, attempting to account for the main micro-circuits identified in the human cortex, while including the specificities of each neuronal type. More specifically, the model accounts for thalamo-cortical (vertical) regulation of cortico-cortical (horizontal) connectivity, which is a central mechanism for brain information integration and processing. The distinct neuronal assemblies communicate through feedforward and feedback excitatory and inhibitory synaptic connections implemented in a template brain accounting for long-range connectome. The EEG generated by this physiologically-based simulated brain is validated through comparison with brain rhythms recorded in humans in two states of consciousness (wakefulness, sleep). Using the model, it is possible to reproduce the local disynaptic disinhibition of basket cells (fast GABAergic inhibition) and glutamatergic pyramidal neurons through long-range activation of VIP interneurons that induced inhibition of SST interneurons. The model (COALIA) predicts that the strength and dynamics of the thalamic output on the cortex control the local and long-range cortical processing of information. Furthermore, the model reproduces and explains clinical results regarding the complexity of transcranial magnetic stimulation TMS-evoked EEG responses in DOC patients and healthy volunteers, through a modulation of thalamo-cortical connectivity that governs the level of cortico-cortical communication. This new model provides a quantitative framework to accelerate the study of the physiological mechanisms involved in the emergence, maintenance and disruption (sleep, anesthesia, DOC) of consciousness.},

It was found that the simulated VEP activity was mainly due to intracortical excitatory connections rather than direct thalamic input. Also, the model-generated VEPs exhibited similar relationships between prestimulus EEG characteristics and subsequent VEP morphology, as seen in human data. Specifically, the large correlation between the N1 amplitude and the prestimulus alpha phase angle, and the insensitivity of P2 to the latter feature, as observed in actual VEPs to low intensity flashes, was also found in the model-generated data. These findings provide support for the hypothesis that the spontaneous EEG and the VEP are generated by some of the same neural structures and that the VEP is due to distributed activity, rather than dipolar sources.},

A previously developed lumped-parameter model of a single cortical column was implemented using a more accurate computational procedure. Anatomically acceptable values for the various model parameters were determined, and a multi-dimensional exploration of the model parameter-space was conducted. It was found that the model could produce a large variety of EEG-like waveforms and rhythms. Coupling two models, with delays in the interconnections to simulate the synaptic connections within and between cortical areas, made it possible to replicate the spatial distribution of alpha and beta activity. EPs were simulated by presenting pulses to the input of the coupled models. In general, the responses were more realistic than those produced using a single model. Our simulations also suggest that the scalp-recorded EP is at least partially due to a phase reordering of the ongoing activity.},

Clinical EEG data shows that Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) alters these rhythms. Researchers have developed lumped parameter neural mass models (NMM) that can reproduce these various brain rhythms. This paper proposes an NMM based computational model of mild TBI that recreates the clinical EEG changes observed after injury. Specifically, the focus is on recreating changes observed after TBI in the 8-12 Hz alpha and the 4-8Hz theta frequency ranges. Mild TBI is simulated by increasing membrane reactivity and by decreasing synaptic connectivity in the NMM. These results indicate that clinically observed EEG changes with mild TBI are likely due to traumatic synaptic disruption and that with appropriate data, EEG may be used to quantify the extent of TBI in the future.},

A basic requirement for computational modeling studies is the availability of efficient software for setting up models and performing numerical simulations. While many such tools exist for different families of neural models, there is a lack of tools allowing for both a generic model definition and efficiently parallelized simulations. In this work, we present PyRates, a Python framework that provides the means to build a large variety of rate-based neural models. PyRates provides intuitive access to and modification of all mathematical operators in a graph, thus allowing for a highly generic model definition. For computational efficiency and parallelization, the model is translated into a compute graph. Using the example of two different neural models belonging to the family of rate-based population models, we explain the mathematical formalism, software structure and user interfaces of PyRates. We show via numerical simulations that the behavior of the PyRates model implementations is consistent with the literature. Finally, we demonstrate the computational capacities and scalability of PyRates via a number of benchmark simulations of neural networks differing in size and connectivity.},

	abstract = {Although MEG/EEG signals are highly variable, systematic changes in distinct frequency bands are commonly encountered. These frequency-specific changes represent robust neural correlates of cognitive or perceptual processes (for example, alpha rhythms emerge on closing the eyes). However, their functional significance remains a matter of debate. Some of the mechanisms that generate these signals are known at the cellular level and rest on a balance of excitatory and inhibitory interactions within and between populations of neurons. The kinetics of the ensuing population dynamics determine the frequency of oscillations. In this work we extended the classical nonlinear lumped-parameter model of alpha rhythms, initially developed by Lopes da Silva and colleagues [Kybernetik 15 (1974) 27], to generate more complex dynamics. We show that the whole spectrum of MEG/EEG signals can be reproduced within the oscillatory regime of this model by simply changing the population kinetics. We used the model to examine the influence of coupling strength and propagation delay on the rhythms generated by coupled cortical areas. The main findings were that (1) coupling induces phase-locked activity, with a phase shift of 0 or π when the coupling is bidirectional, and (2) both coupling and propagation delay are critical determinants of the MEG/EEG spectrum. In forthcoming articles, we will use this model to (1) estimate how neuronal interactions are expressed in MEG/EEG oscillations and establish the construct validity of various indices of nonlinear coupling, and (2) generate event-related transients to derive physiologically informed basis functions for statistical modelling of average evoked responses.},

	abstract = {Modeling the dynamics of neural masses is a common approach in the study of neural populations. Various models have been proven useful to describe a plenitude of empirical observations including self-sustained local oscillations and patterns of distant synchronization. We discuss the extent to which mass models really resemble the mean dynamics of a neural population. In particular, we question the validity of neural mass models if the population under study comprises a mixture of excitatory and inhibitory neurons that are densely (inter-)connected. Starting from a network of noisy leaky integrate-and-fire neurons, we formulated two different population dynamics that both fall into the category of seminal Freeman neural mass models. The derivations contained several mean-field assumptions and time scale separation(s) between membrane and synapse dynamics. Our comparison of these neural mass models with the averaged dynamics of the population reveals bounds in the fraction of excitatory/inhibitory neuron as well as overall network degree for a mass model to provide adequate estimates. For substantial parameter ranges, our models fail to mimic the neural network's dynamics proper, be that in de-synchronized or in (high-frequency) synchronized states. Only around the onset of low-frequency synchronization our models provide proper estimates of the mean potential dynamics. While this shows their potential for, e.g., studying resting state dynamics obtained by encephalography with focus on the transition region, we must accept that predicting the more general dynamic outcome of a neural network via its mass dynamics requires great care.},

The behaviour of this network is studied for sinusoidal and white noise inputs. First steady state conditions are investigated and with this as starting point the linearized network is defined and conditions for stability is discovered. With white noise as input the stable network produces rhythmic activity whose spectral properties are investigated for various input levels. With a mean input of a certain level the network becomes unstable and the characteristics of these limit cycles are investigated in terms of occurence and amplitude.

The anaesthetic propofol causes a prolongation of the actions of the inhibitory populations.  An NMM might explain the change in ERs appearance caused by the inhibitory effect of propofol.
A retrospective analysis determined that a subset of two stimuli per stimulation pair instead of ten stimuli resulted in similar cortico-cortical networks. A prospective analysis showed that performing intra-operative SPES is feasible and that similar functional connectivity of electrodes was found. With the analysis of a computational model, we determined that adaptations of the inhibitory populations suffice to invoke the experimentally observed effect of propofol on an ECoG response.}

Besides several characteristic features of anesthesia observed in experiments, a prominent effect is the bi-phasic change of power in the observed electroencephalogram (EEG), i.e. the initial increase and subsequent decrease of the EEG-power in several frequency bands while increasing the concentration of the anaesthetic agent. The present work aims to derive analytical conditions for this bi-phasic spectral behavior by the study of a neural population model. This model describes mathematically the effective membrane potential and involves excitatory and inhibitory synapses, excitatory and inhibitory cells, nonlocal spatial interactions and a ﬁnite axonal conduction speed. The work derives conditions for synaptic time constants based on experimental results and gives conditions on the resting state stability. Further the power spectrum of Local Field Potentials and EEG generated by the neural activity is derived analytically and allow for the detailed study of bi-spectral power changes. We ﬁnd bi-phasic power changes both in monostable and bistable system regime, afﬁrming the omnipresence of bi-spectral power changes in anesthesia.

	abstract = {When treating patients with a disorder of consciousness (DOC), it is essential to obtain an accurate diagnosis as soon as possible to generate individualized treatment programs. However, accurately diagnosing patients with DOCs is challenging and prone to errors when differentiating patients in a Vegetative State/Unresponsive Wakefulness Syndrome (VS/UWS) from those in a Minimally Conscious State (MCS). Upwards of {\textasciitilde}40\% of patients with a DOC can be misdiagnosed when specifically designed behavioral scales are not employed or improperly administered. To improve diagnostic accuracy for these patients, several important neuroimaging and electrophysiological technologies have been proposed. These include Positron Emission Tomography (PET), functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), Electroencephalography (EEG), and Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS). Here, we review the different ways in which these techniques can improve diagnostic differentiation between VS/UWS and MCS patients. We do so by referring to studies that were conducted within the last 10 years, which were extracted from the PubMed database. In total, 55 studies met our criteria (clinical diagnoses of VS/UWS from MCS as made by PET, fMRI, EEG and TMS- EEG tools) and were included in this review. By summarizing the promising results achieved in understanding and diagnosing these conditions, we aim to emphasize the need for more such tools to be incorporated in standard clinical practice, as well as the importance of data sharing to incentivize the community to meet these goals.},

A 24-h polysomnography was performed in 20 patients who were in a UWS (n = 10) or in a MCS (n = 10) because of brain injury. The data were ﬁrst tested for the presence of a sleep-wake cycle, and the observed sleep patterns were compared with standard scoring criteria. Sleep spindles, slow wave sleep, and rapid eye movement sleep were quantiﬁed and their clinical value was investigated. According to our results, an electrophysiological sleep-wake cycle was identiﬁed in ﬁve MCS and three VS/UWS patients. Sleep stages did not always match the standard scoring criteria, which therefore needed to be adapted. Sleep spindles were present more in patients who clinically improved within 6 months. Slow wave sleep was present in eight MCS and three VS/UWS patients but never in the ischemic etiology. Rapid eye movement sleep, and therefore dreaming that is a form of consciousness, was present in all MCS and three VS/UWS patients. In conclusion, the presence of alternating periods of eyes-open/eyes-closed cycles does not necessarily imply preserved electrophysiological sleep architecture in the UWS and MCS, contrary to previous deﬁnition. The investigation of sleep is a little studied yet simple and informative way to evaluate the integrity of residual brain function in patients with disorders of consciousness with possible clinical diagnostic and prognostic implications.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          The human brain generates a rich repertoire of spatiotemporal dynamics during normal wakefulness, supporting a wide variety of conscious experiences and cognitive functions. However, neural dynamics are reconfigured, in comparable ways, when consciousness is lost either due to anaesthesia or disorders of consciousness (DOC). Here, leveraging a neurobiologically realistic whole-brain computational model informed by functional MRI, diffusion MRI, and PET, we sought to identify the neurobiological mechanisms that explain the common reconfiguration of neural dynamics observed both for transient pharmacological intervention and chronic neuroanatomical injury. Our results show that, by incorporating local inhibitory action through a PET-based GABA receptor density map, our model can reproduce the brain dynamics of subjects undergoing propofol anaesthesia, and that this effect depends specifically on the spatial distribution of GABA receptors across cortical regions. Additionally, using a structural connectome obtained from DOC patients, we demonstrate how the dynamics that characterise loss of consciousness can emerge from changes in neuroanatomical connectivity. Crucially, we find that each of these two interventions generalises across datasets: a model with increased GABA-mediated inhibition can reproduce the dynamics of DOC patients’ brains, and a model with a DOC connectome is also compatible with brain dynamics observed during propofol anaesthesia. These results demonstrate how increased inhibition and connectome randomisation represent different neurobiological paths towards the characteristic dynamics of the unconscious brain. Overall, the present findings begin to disentangle the neurobiological mechanisms by which highly dissimilar perturbations of the brain’s neurodynamics can lead to unconsciousness.},

	abstract = {Propofol is a widely used intravenous general anesthetic. Propofol-induced unconsciousness in humans is associated with inhibition of thalamic activity evoked by somatosensory stimuli. However, the cellular mechanisms underlying the effects of propofol in thalamic circuits are largely unknown. We investigated the influence of propofol on synaptic responsiveness of thalamocortical relay neurons in the ventrobasal complex (VB) to excitatory input in mouse brain slices, using both current- and voltage-clamp recording techniques. Excitatory responses including EPSP temporal summation and action potential firing were evoked in VB neurons by electrical stimulation of corticothalamic fibers or pharmacological activation of glutamate receptors. Propofol (0.6 – 3 µM) suppressed temporal summation and spike firing in a concentration-dependent manner. The thalamocortical suppression was accompanied by a marked decrease in both EPSP amplitude and input resistance, indicating that a shunting mechanism was involved. The propofol-mediated thalamocortical suppression could be blocked by a GABAA receptor antagonist or chloride channel blocker, suggesting that postsynaptic GABAA receptors in VB neurons were involved in the shunting inhibition. GABAA receptor-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) were evoked in VB neurons by electrical stimulation of the reticular thalamic nucleus. Propofol markedly increased amplitude, decay time, and charge transfer of GABAA IPSCs. The results demonstrated that shunting inhibition of thalamic somatosensory relay neurons by propofol at clinically relevant concentrations is primarily mediated through the potentiation of the GABAA receptor chloride channel-mediated conductance, and such inhibition may contribute to the impaired thalamic responses to sensory stimuli seen during propofol-induced anesthesia.},

Thus, no single concentration based on a population average will prove optimal for individual patients. We therefore tested the hypothesis that individual propofol effectsite concentrations at loss and return of consciousness are similar. Propofol effect-site concentrations at loss and recovery of consciousness were estimated with a target-control infusion system in 20 adults. Propofol effect-site concentrations were gradually increased until the volunteers lost consciousness (no response to verbal stimuli); unconsciousness was maintained for 15 minutes, and the volunteers were then awakened. This protocol was repeated three times in each volunteer. Our major outcomes were the concentration producing unconsciousness and the relationship between the estimated effect-site concentrations at loss and recovery of consciousness. The target effect-site propofol concentration was 2.0 ± 0.9 at loss of consciousness and 1.8 ± 0.7 at return of consciousness (P {\textless} 0.001). The average difference between individual effect-site concentrations at return and loss of consciousness was only 0.17 ± 0.32 μg/mL (95\% confidence interval for the difference 0.09 to 0.25 μg/mL). Our results thus suggest that individual titration to loss of consciousness is an alternative to dosing propofol on the basis of average population requirements.},

However, the ‘conscious’ and ‘anaesthetised’ conditions produced by general anaesthetics may behave as two bistable states. We hypothesised that loss of responsiveness and recovery of responsiveness occur at different propofol concentrations. Propofol was administered to 19 healthy volunteers by effect-site target-controlled infusion using increasing and decreasing stable concentration steps of 7 min. Propofol serum concentrations were measured from venous blood samples at the end of each 7-min step. A long step of 14 min was performed at loss of responsiveness. At this step, propofol concentrations were measured at 7 and 14 min. Propofol concentrations measured at loss of responsiveness and recovery of responsiveness were 2.6 (1.2–4.7) lg.mlÀ1 and 1.6 (0.6–3.3) lg.mlÀ1, respectively (p {\textless} 0.001). Propofol plasma concentration and the corresponding bispectral index values measured at minute 7 and minute 14 of the long step performed at loss of responsiveness were 2.6 (1.2–4.7) vs. 2.6 (1.3–4.3) at recovery of responsiveness, (p = 0.96) and 61.2 (49.0–77.0) vs. 58.4 (45.0–74.0), (p = 0.058), respectively. Loss of responsiveness and recovery of responsiveness appear to occur at different propofol concentrations. However, it is possible that, if equilibration was not achieved between plasma and effect-sites at the end of each 7-min step, the higher concentrations found at loss of responsiveness compared with those observed during recovery of responsiveness could be explained by a possible bias in estimations of the effect-site concentrations of propofol by the Schnider model, rather than neural inertia.},

	abstract = {Propofol, the relatively new, short-acting general anesthetic, markedly enhances the action of GABA at the GABAA receptor. To evaluate its effects on field potentials evoked in the dentate gyrus ŽDG. during the anesthetic and recovery periods, propofol was administered intraperitoneally to behaving rats bearing stimulating electrodes in the dorsal perforant path ŽDPP., where medial perforant path fibers predominate, and in the anterior piriform cortex ŽPC; i.e., olfactory cortex., and recording electrodes in the DG. Input from the PC reaches the DG via the lateral perforant path. Population slow waves ŽSWs. were evoked by paired-pulse stimulation of the PC at a 32 ms interstimulus interval ŽISI. to produce paired-pulse facilitation in the awake animal. We had previously demonstrated that amplitude of SW2 Žproduced by the second stimulus. was greatly decreased by GABAergic drugs and increased by antiGABAergic convulsant agents. After administration of propofol, mean amplitude of SW2 decreased immediately and remained low for 30–60 min during propofol-induced sleep Žas expected., then unexpectedly increased to about 1.5- to 2-fold above pretreatment levels at 2–4 h before gradually returning to pretreatment levels. In addition, the DPP was stimulated to produce either paired-pulse inhibition Ž20 ms ISI. or facilitation Ž32 ms ISI. of DG population spikes ŽPSs. in the awake animal. PS2 was much more inhibited during propofol-induced sleep, than during the pretreatment period, consistent with an expected marked increase in recurrent inhibition. An overshoot in PS2 amplitude was observed only occasionally during recovery, suggesting that withdrawal overshoot in amplitudes is more characteristic of PC-evoked DG SW2 potentials. The overshoot in SW2 amplitude during recovery may have been related to propofol’s ‘rapid on–rapid off’ actions on the GABAA receptor, perhaps resulting in a phenomenon like the ‘GABA withdrawal syndrome’. Such an effect, if true, may help explain the rare occurrence of seizures, especially during recovery, associated with its use clinically. q 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The anesthetic propofol is thought to induce rapid hypnotic sedation by facilitating a GABAergic tonic current in forebrain neurons. The depression of cardiovascular and respiratory regulation often observed during propofol suggests potential additional actions within the brainstem. Here we determined the impacts of propofol on both GABAergic and glutamatergic synaptic mechanisms in a class of solitary tract nucleus (NTS) neurons common to brainstem reflex pathways. In horizontal brainstem slices, we recorded from NTS neurons directly activated by solitary tract (ST) axons. We identified these second-order NTS neurons by time-invariant (“jitter” {\textless}200 µs), “all-or-none” glutamatergic excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) in response to shocks to the ST. In order to assess propofol actions, we measured ST-evoked, spontaneous and miniature EPSCs and inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) during propofol exposure. Propofol prolonged miniature IPSC decay time constants by 50\% above control at 1.8 µM. Low concentrations of gabazine (SR-95531) blocked phasic GABA currents. At higher concentrations, propofol (30 µM) induced a gabazine-insensitive tonic current that was blocked by picrotoxin or bicuculline. In contrast, total propofol concentrations up to 30 µM had no effect on EPSCs. Thus, propofol enhanced phasic GABA events in NTS at lower concentrations than tonic current induction, opposite to the relative sensitivity observed in forebrain regions. These data suggest that therapeutic levels of propofol facilitate phasic (synaptic) inhibitory transmission in second order NTS neurons which likely inhibits autonomic reflex pathways during anesthesia.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pharmacokinetic (PK) models are used to predict drug concentrations for infusion regimens for intraoperative displays and to calculate infusion rates in target-controlled infusion systems. For propofol, the PK models available in the literature were mostly developed from particular patient groups or anesthetic techniques, and there is uncertainty of the accuracy of the models under differing patient and clinical conditions. Our goal was to determine a PK model with robust predictive performance for a wide range of patient groups and clinical conditions.
METHODS: We aggregated and analyzed 21 previously published propofol datasets containing data from young children, children, adults, elderly, and obese individuals. A 3-compartmental allometric model was estimated with NONMEM software using weight, age, sex, and patient status as covariates. A predictive performance metric focused on intraoperative conditions was devised and used along with the Akaike information criteria to guide model development.
RESULTS: The dataset contains 10,927 drug concentration observations from 660 individuals (age range 0.25–88 years; weight range 5.2–160 kg). The final model uses weight, age, sex, and patient versus healthy volunteer as covariates. Parameter estimates for a 35-year, 70-kg male patient were: 9.77, 29.0, 134 L, 1.53, 1.42, and 0.608 L/min for V1, V2, V3, CL, Q2, and Q3, respectively. Predictive performance is better than or similar to that of specialized models, even for the subpopulations on which those models were derived.
CONCLUSIONS: We have developed a single propofol PK model that performed well for a wide range of patient groups and clinical conditions. Further prospective evaluation of the model is needed.  (Anesth Analg 2014;118:1221–37)},

            Can You Hear Me Now?
            What actually happens in your brain when you lose awareness of what is going on around you? Clinicians would like to know so they can monitor awareness in the operating room without requiring the person to respond to a sound or a touch. Ní Mhuircheartaigh and colleagues have found a signal in the EEG (electrical brain waves recorded from outside the head) that may reflect this transition.
            The authors gave the drug propofol to 16 individuals and monitored their EEGs. In each patient, as the drug concentrations in their system rose, the amplitude of electrical waves of a certain frequency (slow-wave activity) grew. Eventually, the slow-wave amplitude reached a plateau and, even though drug concentrations continued to increase, the amplitude stayed at this plateau value. To test whether the transition to the plateau represented the point at which the subjects lost awareness, they performed simultaneous functional magnetic resonance imaging and sensory stimulation. The beginning of the plateau coincided with the point at which sensory signals no longer reached the thalamocortical portion of the brain, rendering it an “island” of activity. Unexpectedly, other brain regions still responded to stimuli, including posterior parietal and prefrontal cortices.
            Although more studies of slow-wave activity and its relation to perceptual awareness are needed, the transition of slow-wave activity to saturation is a potential individualized index of sensory isolation that may prove useful in the operating room.

            The altered state of consciousness produced by general anesthetics is associated with a variety of changes in the brain’s electrical activity. Under hyperpolarizing influences such as anesthetic drugs, cortical neurons oscillate at {\textasciitilde}1 Hz, which is measurable as slow waves in the electroencephalogram (EEG). We have administered propofol anesthesia to 16 subjects and found that, after they had lost behavioral responsiveness (response to standard sensory stimuli), each individual’s EEG slow-wave activity (SWA) rose to saturation and then remained constant despite increasing drug concentrations. We then simultaneously collected functional magnetic resonance imaging and EEG data in 12 of these subjects during propofol administration and sensory stimulation. During the transition to SWA saturation, the thalamocortical system became isolated from sensory stimuli, whereas internal thalamocortical exchange persisted. Rather, an alternative and more fundamental cortical network (which includes the precuneus) responded to all sensory stimulation. We conclude that SWA saturation is a potential individualized indicator of perception loss that could prove useful for monitoring depth of anesthesia and studying altered states of consciousness.},

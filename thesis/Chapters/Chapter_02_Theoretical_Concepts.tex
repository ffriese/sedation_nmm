\chapter{Background \& Starting Points}\label{ch:theoretical-concepts} % Main chapter title
This chapter establishes the necessary foundation for simulating and analysing an EEG signal during anaesthesia.
First, it provides general insights into the origin of the EEG signal and common methods to analyze it.
This is followed by a detailed technical description of the neural mass models implemented in this thesis,
including the derivation of their central functional equations.
It further introduces general anaesthesia and the effects of propofol in that context,
and finally, the reported phenomena in the Steyn-Ross model are discussed,
which serves as a reference for our simulation results.

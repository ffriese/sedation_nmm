\subsection{Measurement}\label{subsec:measurement}
\qquad \todo{how the EEG is measured technically and which neuronal processes it actually
observes (signal amplification, pyramidal cells, ...)}
\subsection{Advantages/Disadvantages}\label{subsec:advantages/disadvantages}
\qquad \todo{spatial/temporal resolution, invasiveness, ...}
\subsection{States of Consciousness in the EEG Signal}\label{subsec:states-of-consciousness-in-the-eeg-signal}
\qquad \todo{how do the states differ in the signal}
\subsubsection{State Detection in healthy Subjects}
 \qquad \qquad \todo{rough explanation of prevalent algorithms}
\subsubsection{State Detection in Subjects with DOC}
 \qquad \qquad \todo{issues with data collection, structurally different source signal, ...}
\subsection{Simulation}\label{subsec:simulation}

\subsubsection{Motivation}
 \qquad \qquad \todo{what can we hope to achieve by simulating an EEG signal}
\subsubsection{Approaches}
 \qquad \qquad \todo{which tools are at our disposal (naive frequency mixing,
    population models, simulating individual neurons, ...)}
 \subsubsection{Model Choice}
 \qquad \qquad \todo{argue about models => why did we land on NMMs/population models?}

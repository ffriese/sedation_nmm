\subsection{Units for propofol concentration}
Some papers~\cite{iwakiri_individual_2005} cite propofol concentrations in $\SI{}{\frac{\micro\gram}{\milli\litre}}$,
while others~\cite{kitamura_effects_2003, mcdougall_propofol_2008} use $\SI{}{\micro\molar}$ (micromolar =
$\SI{}{\frac{\micro\mol}{\litre}}$).
To get comparable numbers, we first need to establish the following relation for Propofol (molar mass: $\SI{178
.27}{\gram}$):
\[ \SI{1}{\frac{\micro\gram\hspace{0.5em}\text{\tiny{Propofol}}}{\milli\litre}}  =
\frac{ \SI{1}{\frac{\micro\gram}{\milli\litre}}}{\SI{178.27}{\frac{\gram}{\mol}}} = \SI{5.609}{\micro\molar} \]
In this work, we will settle on $\SI{}{\micro\molar}$
and only mention values in $\SI{}{\frac{\micro\gram}{\milli\litre}}$ where they are taken from a source,
but then provide the converted value as well.


\subsection{Realistic propofol concentrations during general anaesthesia (GA)}\label{subsec:realistic-prop-conc-during-ga}

During GA, effect-site concentrations ($c_{e}$, concentration near the synaptic receptors) of propofol may easily range
up to
$\SI{5}{\frac{\micro\gram}{\milli\litre}} (\approx\SI{28}{\micro\molar})$.
Loss of Consciousness (LOC) occurs on average at $c_e \sim\SI{2.0}{\frac{\micro\gram}{\milli\litre}} (\approx\SI{11
.2}{\micro\molar})$,
while the Return of Consciousness (ROC) averages at $c_e \sim\SI{1.8}{\frac{\micro\gram}{\milli\litre}}
(\approx\SI{10.1}{\micro\molar})$.
Both values may vary substantially for individual subjects.
LOC has a strong tendency to occur at higher concentrations than ROC~\cite{iwakiri_individual_2005,
    ferreira_patterns_2020}.
Throughout GA, effect-site concentration is commonly derived from measured
blood-plasma concentration ($c_p$) using more or less complex Pharmacokinetic (PK)-Models
(e.g.\ ~\cite{eleveld_general_2014, liang_pharmacokinetics-neural_2015}),
as direct measurement is impractical for obvious reasons.
Since our model will work with $c_{e}$ directly, we will disregard this for now - however, it should be kept in mind.


\subsection{Effects of propofol on the IPSP}

Research on the effect of propofol on the IPSC (Inhibitory Post-Synaptic Current) and EPSC
has shown that propofol strongly affects the IPSP decay time \cite{kitamura_effects_2003, mcdougall_propofol_2008}.
The EPSP and the amplitude of the IPSP are unaffected by propofol.
Effect-site concentrations at clinically relevant levels increase the IPSP decay time
significantly (e.g.\ around $\SI{10}{\micro\molar}$ the decay time roughly doubles)~\cite{kitamura_effects_2003}.

Using the data-points from~\cite{kitamura_effects_2003}
and assuming a very rough manual logarithmic fit (see Fig.~\ref{fig:lambda_fit}),
the function
        \[ \mathscr{D}(c_{e}) = 0.65*ln((c_{e}/2)+1)+1 \]
will be used to calculate the decay-time factor $\lambda$ from a given
effect-site concentration in $\SI{}{\micro\molar}$.

As there unfortunately were only a few data-points (and none above $\SI{10}{\micro\molar}$,
leaving a large part of the relevant parameter space empty),
a computational model-fit might have over-valued those points.
A visually fitted logarithmic function (assuming eventual effect saturation) seemed like a sensible choice
for this use-case.
However, since inter-subject variations are substantial in any case,
the exact values do not matter as much as the order of magnitude.

\subsection{Hysteresis of propofol}
If the state of a system depends not only on its parameters, but also the systems history,
this dependency is called hysteresis.
The human body often reacts differently to the same concentration of a drug,
depending on whether the concentration is rising or decaying.
Hysteresis is well documented during propofol-induced GA~\cite{kuizenga_quantitative_1998,
    iwakiri_individual_2005,
    sepulveda_evidence_2018,ferreira_patterns_2020, su_hysteresis_2020}.
The most prominent effect being a counter-clockwise hysteresis for LOC and ROC (as mentioned
in~\ref{subsec:realistic-prop-conc-during-ga}).
The effects on responsiveness of subjects usually start at higher concentrations than they end.
While some of that effect might be caused by inaccurate PK-Models,
misgauging the actual effect-site concentration,
there is a growing body of research that supports the notion that the observed effect is independent of
pharmacokinetic interference~\cite{hutt_progress_2011, su_hysteresis_2020}.

\section{Exploring realistic parameter ranges}\label{sec:simulation-over-the-parameter-space}

When simulating a linear increase and subsequent decrease over the selected parameter space for
$ \lambda \in \left[ 1, 3 \right] $ (see Fig~\ref{fig:sedation_sim_jr} \textbf{A}),
the following phenomena can be observed:

\def\simRunName{JR_LONGER_INIT}
\def\locStart{1.1}
\def\locST{6.61}
\def\locEnd{2.07}
\def\locET{18.89}
\def\rocStart{2.0}
\def\rocST{48.63}
\def\rocEnd{1.00}
\def\rocET{62.0}
\subsection{Phenomenology of the Basic JR Model}
    In the baseline state ($\lambda = 1$), the model produces the expected well-defined alpha-activity
    with a sharp frequency peak at $\SI{12}{\hertz}$.
\newremark{Spectrogram Amplitude}{
    At this point, it should be noted
    that even though the spectrogram (Fig~\ref{fig:sedation_sim_jr}b appears to contain a frequency range
    from roughly 6--18Hz at the beginning of the simulation,
    this is misleading.
    The extremely high-amplitude 12Hz peak has noisy flanks with low amplitudes
    (compare to the spectrum in Fig.~\ref{fig:initial_oscilations}c \& d),
    which are highlighted by the chosen colormap and value range.
    Their relative contribution to the signal is close to insignificant in this case.
}
    Increasing the simulated propofol levels first leads to the single dominant frequency at $\SI{12}{\hertz} $
    descending towards $\SI{10}{\hertz} $.
    When reaching $\lambda \approx \locStart $,
    there is an onset of heavy oscillations, characterized by dramatically increasing signal amplitude
    with frequencies peaking at around $0--10, 12--20$ and $ \SI{30}{\hertz} $,
    but extending up to $\sim \SI{35}{\hertz} $.
    Further increase of the concentration shifts the frequency peaks of the disturbed signal slowly towards lower
    values, also decreasing their distance to each other.
    Additionally, higher values of $\lambda$ appear to linearly decrease the mean signal voltage.
    Another sudden change occurs around $\lambda \approx \locEnd $,
    where the disturbances disappear again,
    with the system having apparently reached a different stable state with very low activity.
    Signal amplitude is drastically reduced, with remaining activity mostly below $\SI{10}{\hertz}$.
    The single dominant frequency has disappeared completely.
    From there on, the mean signal voltage slowly continues to slightly decrease as before,
    however, the frequency distribution appears to have settled.
    After reaching peak dosage at $\lambda = 3.0$, maintaining it for a few seconds has no further effects.
    Subsequent concentration decrease has the expected reverse effects:
    At first only the signal voltage slightly increases,
    then disturbances begin to form again at $\lambda \approx \rocStart$.
    On the return path, effects roughly mirror the induction.
    It takes a few seconds after $\lambda$ returns to its initial value until the initial state is restored.

\subsection{Phenomenology of the David Friston Extension}
    Section~\ref{subsec:the-david-and-friston-model} introduces the David--Friston model and
    the mixture of slow and fast kinetics within a population.
    This results in an initial frequency spectrum,
    that lacks the distinct high-amplitude peak and instead has a wider distribution with far lower amplitude.

\newremark{Spectrogram Amplitude}{
    Fig.~\ref{fig:sedation_sim_jr}c and Fig.~\ref{fig:sedation_sim_df}c have the same
    color-map and amplitude-range.
    In contrast to the spectrogram of the JR-Model,
    the low-amplitude activity is significant from the start here,
    as it makes up the whole baseline signal.
}
    The DF model initially produces a dominant frequency range at $10-20 \SI{}{\hertz} $,
    which slowly shifts towards $ 5-10 \SI{}{\hertz} $ (\textbf{C}) when $\lambda$ starts to increase.
    The mean signal voltage concurrently decreases,
    while oscillation-amplitude is maintained (Fig~\ref{fig:sedation_sim_df} \textbf{B}).
    The system appears to be in a stable state until $ \lambda \approx \locStart $,
    where the sudden onset of dramatically
    increasing signal amplitude with strongly pronounced activity below $ \SI{25}{\hertz} $
    creates multiple strong frequency peaks.
    Unlike in the JR model, the oscillations do not exceed  $ \SI{30}{\hertz} $.
    Further increasing $\lambda$ has the same minimal effects on the disturbed signal,
    as the increase had before exiting the stable state.
    The heavy oscillations remain until $\lambda \approx \locEnd $,
    where the dominant frequencies move below $\SI{10}{\hertz}$.
    Continuing, the signal voltage slowly decreases as before,
    however the frequency distribution appears to have settled.
    Maintaining peak dosage has no further effects.
    Decreasing the simulated propofol levels again first increases the mean signal voltage,
    until the stable state dissolves into heavy oscillations around $\lambda \approx \rocStart$.
    The unstable state prevails until $\lambda$ reaches $\approx \rocEnd$.

\section{Similarities and Differences}
    Both models share some key features during these simulations:
    Three, distinguishable states can be observed.
    The initial stable state is followed by a state that is defined by strong harmonic frequencies and dramatically
    increased signal amplitude.
    From there, the system transitions into a low-power state with low frequencies,
    which seems to be mostly saturated and changes little to further increasing agent concentration.
    Induction and emergence are asymmetrical, even if only marginally so in the JR model.
    The system predicts that the frequency range below $\SI{25}{\hertz}$ receives a temporary amplitude boost during
    the phase transitions, which disappears while the parameter changes continue in the same direction.


There are also a few striking differences between the two simulation sessions:
By design,
the JR model produces exclusively near-sinusoid single-peak alpha-activity in the initial state ($\lambda = 1$),
while the DF model creates a range of alpha- and beta-activity.
The JR model spends significant amounts of the session in the second, high-amplitude state,
while these sections are significantly shorter for the DF model.
Also, in the DF model,
the parameter ranges that cause the two high-amplitude states "LOC" and "ROC" differ decisively.
The "LOC"-transition not only ends at a slightly higher $\lambda$ value ($2.05$) than the start of the
"ROC"-transition ($1.95$).
It also starts far higher ($1.85$) than the "ROC" ends ($1.5$).
Consequently, the "LOC" value-range is far shorter ($\text{length}=0.2$) than the "ROC" range
($\text{length}=0.45$).
In the JR model this effect is present as well, but hardly noticeable,
since the differences are much smaller ($2.07$ vs $2.0$ and $1.1$ vs $1.0$).

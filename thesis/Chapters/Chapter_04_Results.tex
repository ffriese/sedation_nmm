\section{Simulation over the parameter space}\label{sec:simulation-over-the-parameter-space}

When simulating a linear increase and subsequent decrease over the selected parameter space for
$ \lambda \in \left[ 1, 3 \right] $ (see Fig~\ref{fig:sedation_sim_jr} \textbf{A}),
the following phenomena can be observed:

\subsection{Phenomenology of the Basic JR Model}
\todo{improve descriptions}
    Increasing the simulated propofol levels first leads to a slight decrease in mean signal voltage, while roughly
    maintaining oscillation-amplitude (Fig~\ref{fig:sedation_sim_jr} \textbf{B}).
    The dominant frequencies are in the $ 10-12 \SI{}{\hertz} $ range, but appear to start slowly descending.
    Overall the system appears to be in a stable state,
    until lambda reaches $ \lambda \sim 1.1 $.
    At that point there is an onset of heavy oscillations, characterized by dramatically increasing signal amplitude
    with frequencies peaking at around $0-10, 12-20$ and $ \SI{30}{\hertz} $.
    Further increase shifts the frequency peaks of the disturbed signal slowly towards lower values.
    Another sudden change occurs around $\lambda \sim 2.05 $,
    where the disturbances disappear again,
    with the system having apparently reached a different stable state.
    The dominant frequencies have moved below $2- \SI{3}{\hertz}$,
    and there is only low-amplitude activity in frequencies above that.
    From there on, the mean signal voltage slowly continues to slightly decrease as before,
    however the frequency distribution appears to have settled.
    Maintaining peak dosage has no further effects.
    Subsequent decrease has the expected reverse effect at first: only the signal voltage slightly increases
    as well.
    Disturbances begin to form again at $\lambda \sim 1.95$.
    The system undergoes similar effects on the return path as it did during induction.

\subsection{Phenomenology of the David Friston Extension}

    Initial increase of $\lambda$ decreases the mean signal voltage, while maintaining oscillation-amplitude
(Fig~\ref{fig:sedation_sim_df} \textbf{B}).
    Dominant frequencies from the $ 10-12 \SI{}{\hertz} $ range slowly shift towards
    $ 5-10 \SI{}{\hertz} $ (\textbf{C}).
    The system appears to be in a stable state until $ \lambda \sim 1.85 $,
    where the sudden onset of dramatically
    increasing signal amplitude with strongly pronounced frequency activity below $ \SI{25}{\hertz} $.
    Further increasing $\lambda$ has the same minimal effects on the disturbed signal,
    as the increase had before exiting the stable state.
    The heavy oscillations remain until $\lambda \sim 2.05 $,
    where the dominant frequencies move below $\SI{10}{\hertz}$.
    Continuing, the signal voltage slowly continues to decrease as before,
    however the frequency distribution appears to have settled.
    Maintaining peak dosage has no further effects.
    Decreasing the simulated propofol levels again first increases the mean signal voltage,
    until the stable state dissolves into heavy oscillations around $\lambda \sim 1.95$.
    The unstable state prevails until $\lambda$ reaches $\sim 1.48$.

\section{Differences}
\todo{highlight relevant ("striking") differences and similarities}
\todo{move interpretation to discussion}
\todo{what is the impact?}
\todo{transition into discussion}
While the NMM used for simulation is a very rough abstraction of cortical dynamics,
multiple parallels to effects observed during GA can be drawn:

    Two, distinguishable \textbf{stable states} can be observed.
    The frequency changes bear strong similarities to the switch to unconsciousness in GA
    \cite{purdon_electroencephalogram_2013, ni_mhuircheartaigh_slow_wave_2013}.
    Induction and Emergence are asymmetrical (\textbf{hysteresis}).
    The system predicts that the state-change `LOC` occurs at higher concentrations than `ROC`.
    During state transitions, there is a strong \textbf{biphasic effect}.
    The system predicts that the frequency range below $\SI{25}{\hertz}$ receives a temporary amplitude boost during
    the phase transitions, which disappears while the parameter changes continue in the same direction.
    In the `unconscious` state, frequency distribution stabilizes independent of further increasing decay-time
    (\textbf{slow-wave-activity saturation}?~\cite{ni_mhuircheartaigh_slow_wave_2013}).

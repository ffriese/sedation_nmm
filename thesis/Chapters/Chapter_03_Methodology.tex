After establishing the theory required to address our goals,
the next step is the actual implementation of the two models,
the validation of their output (\ref{goal:jr_model},~\ref{goal:df_model}),
and the introduction of a decay-time parameter, which enables modulation of the IPSP (\ref{goal:implement_propofol}).

Instead of implementing the NMMs from scratch,
multiple existing simulation frameworks were considered as a base for this thesis.
The PyRates Framework~\cite{gast_pyratespython_2019} was quickly identified as a flexible and powerful choice
for building custom NMMs.
The following section introduces the PyRates simulation framework
and provides examples of the specific implementation of the JR and DF model.
The implementations are also validated for correctness.
Furthermore, it discusses how the decay-time parameter is added to the implementation.
Lastly, it provides some details on the methodology of analysing the generated data.
